The dataset describes patients from the [MIMIC III database](https://mimic.physionet.org/mimictables/patients/) who were put on mechanical ventilation and were stable for 12 hours. Some of these patients then experienced a sudden and sustained drop in oxygenation, while others did not.

A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python interpreter (aka Python installation) and any additional packages/modules that are required for a specific project. It allows you to isolate your project's dependencies from other projects that may have different versions or requirements of the same packages.\n","\n","In this course, we require that you utilize [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to manage your virtual environments.

The Bonferroni correction is a simple method to control the familywise error rate (FWER), which is the probability of making one or more Type I errors in a set of comparisons.\n","\n","To apply the correction, simply divide the desired α level by the number of tests being performed.

Finding the values of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ that minimize the error term is called \"fitting the model\" or \"training the model\".

Matching is a popular technique in causal inference because it allows us to estimate the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome by comparing units that are similar in all aspects except for the treatment. \n","\n","> Note that sometimes \"matching\" is described as mechanism to \"mimic\" or \"emulate\" the randomization of a RCT. This interpretation is incorrect: matching is just a tool you can use to adjust for confounders in a non-randomized study, but does not introduce randomization.\n","\n","In this assignment, we will utilize `propensity scores` to perform a matching analysis. \n","\n","Let's start with the definition: A `propensity score` is the probability that a unit (e.g. an individual in a study) was exposed to a particular **`treatment or exposure`** given their observed characteristics. So in our example, the propensity score of an individual patient is the probability that they had a sudden oxygenation drop (`oxy_drop` is 1) given their other features.\n","\n","A propensity score matching analysis involves the following steps:\n","\n","1. Calculate the propensity scores for each unit in the dataset:\n","    The first step in our process is to determine propensity scores for each unit in the dataset. In our example, we want to calculate the probability that a patient had a sudden oxygenation drop (`oxy_drop` is 1) given their other features. We can do this by fitting a logistic regression model of `oxy_drop` on the other features in the dataset (you do not including the outcome: `death_in_stay`). The predicted probabilities from this model are the propensity scores for each patient.\n","\n","2. Match units based on their propensity scores:\n","    There are multiple strategies to do this, but the idea is that patients who have similar propensity scores are likely to have similar characteristics, and therefore are likely to be comparable in terms of their potential outcomes. In our example, we will use a method called \"Caliper Matching\". We will discribe caliper matching in more detail in the sections below, and utilize it to match patients in the exposure group to patients in the control group (note that not all patients will be matched).\n","\n","3. Run an analysis only utilizing patients that were matched in the previous step.\n","\n","Patients who have similar propensities are more \"twin-like\" and therefore more comparable in terms of their potential outcomes. If two patients have similar propensity scores and one of them was \"exposed\" while the other was not, we can be more confident that any difference in their outcomes is due to the exposure, rather than due to differences in their characteristics."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### `3.2.1` (`5 points`) Propensity Modeling\n","\n","Let's start our propensity analysis by calculating the propensity scores for each patient in the dataset.

In this case, we are using the logit transformation to \"re-scale\" the propensity scores (which are bounded between 0 and 1) to a range that is unbounded. Propensity scores close to 0 suggest a low probability of exposure, while scores close to 1 suggest a high probability of exposure. In some datasets, many scores can cluster near these boundaries, making it hard to visually assess overlap in the distributions. After applying the logit transformation, a propensity score of 0.5 is centered at 0, giving a much more normalized distribution. By transforming to logits, the scores that were clustered near 0 and 1 are spread out more evenly, making it easier to see the distribution of both groups and assess the overlap.\n","\n","The primary goal of propensity score methods in observational studies is to reduce confounding by making the treated and untreated groups comparable in terms of the observed covariates.

First, propensity model is generally used to reduce effects of covariate confounding variables that occur at the same time or before exposure, so that we can try our best to isolate a exposure-only to outcome causal analysis. By including a variable after exposure, we then would risk the post-exposure variable being associated with the exposure, and hence the association between exposure-outcome may be reduced/amplified based on post-exposure's association with exposure.

If the propensity is overfitted on this single set of patient data, then causal inference from downstream analysis may not generalize well to larger populations. Moreover, when there are extreme propensity scores predicted that are either very close to 0 or 1 and if we set the caliper to be very narrow, then it may be hard to find sufficient matching pairs hence causal inference is done on a smaller dataset which may lead to biased conclusion. \n","\n","2. In the matching process, we selected the patient with the closest propensity score and exclude all matched pairs for downstream matching of following patients. This may result in lower number of matched pairs and overall subpar matching results. For example, if patient A have 2 patients (C and D) it could be matched with (same score difference) while patient B have only patient C that it could pair with, when patient A is first randomly matched with C (instead of D which have the same propensity difference), patient B now is left out just because it is later in order during matching.
